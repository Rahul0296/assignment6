    "#1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",

    "\"\"\"Classes and objects are the two main components of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint that defines the properties and behavior of objects. It acts as a template for creating objects, which are instances of the class. For example, a Person class might have properties such as name, age, and address, and behaviors such as walking, talking, and eating.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is a specific instance of a class. It is created from a class and has its own unique set of attributes (data) and methods (functions). For example, a person named John Doe would be an object of the Person class, with the attributes name='John Doe', age=30, and address='123 Main St.'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and objects in OOP are used to encapsulate data and behavior into a single, reusable unit. This promotes code reuse, modularity, and abstraction, making it easier to understand and maintain complex programs.\n",

    "1) Encapsulation: It refers to the wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit called an object. This protects the data from outside interference and accidental modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Abstraction: It refers to the act of hiding the implementation details and showing only the necessary information to the user. This helps to reduce the complexity of the code and makes it easier to understand.\n",
